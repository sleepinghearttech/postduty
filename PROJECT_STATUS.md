## ✅ Phase 1: Tech & Code Setup — COMPLETE

The core website, payment system, and database are complete and tested.

| Task | Status | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Storefront Website | ✅ Done | Product display, detail pages, dynamic pricing from database, Plus Jakarta Sans typography. |
| Razorpay Integration | ✅ Done | Checkout form and payment gateway. Verified working in test mode. |
| Supabase Database | ✅ Done | `products`, `orders`, `order_items` tables with RLS. Mumbai region. |
| Admin Panel | ✅ Done | Secure login panel to manage products (CRUD), change stock, upload photos, and view orders. |
| Order Dashboard | ✅ Done | Dashboard for viewing paid orders, changing status (paid → shipped), saving AWB tracking numbers. |
| Webhook Recovery Safety Net | ✅ Done | Auto-creates orders in the DB if a user closes their browser tab mid-checkout. |
| Race-Condition Fix | ✅ Done | Resolved a bug where webhooks could lock out customer checkout data. Details now merge via idempotency. |

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Customer Notifications — COMPLETE & TESTED

Automatic messages that trigger after order events. Tested and validated end-to-end.

| Task | Status | Trigger | Channel |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Admin Order Alert | ✅ Done | Customer pays | WhatsApp text to admin number |
| Customer Order Confirmation | ✅ Done | Customer pays | WhatsApp template `order_confirmation` (en_IN) |
| Customer Order Receipt | ✅ Done | Customer pays | HTML email via Resend |
| Admin Order Receipt | ✅ Done | Customer pays | HTML email via Resend |
| Customer Shipped Alert | ✅ Done | Admin marks order "shipped" | WhatsApp template `order_shipped` (falls back to text if template not yet approved) |
| Admin Shipped Alert | ✅ Done | Admin marks order "shipped" | WhatsApp text to admin number |
| Customer Shipping Email | ✅ Done | Admin marks order "shipped" | HTML email with tracking number + link to `/orders/[id]` |

**Note:** All notifications fire via `Promise.allSettled` — one failing channel (e.g., WhatsApp) never blocks the others.

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Shopping Cart & Guest Order Tracking — COMPLETE

Enhancements to lift average order value (AOV) and reduce "where is my order?" support load.

| Task | Status | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Client Cart System | ✅ Done | Customers can add items to cart, modify quantities, and check out multiple products in one Razorpay transaction. Cart persists in `localStorage`. |
| Header Cart Icon + Badge | ✅ Done | Dynamic shopping bag icon showing total item count. "Track Order" link in header. |
| "Add to Cart" + "Buy Now" | ✅ Done | Both buttons on product pages. Buy Now = instant single-item checkout. Add to Cart = build a multi-item order. |
| Cart Page (`/cart`) | ✅ Done | Full cart review: line items, quantities, totals, checkout form, and Razorpay trigger. |
| Multi-Item API Support | ✅ Done | `create-order` and `verify-payment` routes accept arrays of items. Backward compatible with single-item "Buy Now" flow. |
| Track Order Page (`/orders`) | ✅ Done | Shows recent orders from `localStorage` + manual lookup by Order ID + email/phone. |
| Order Detail Page (`/orders/[id]`) | ✅ Done | Public shareable page with visual timeline (Paid → Shipped), masked address, item list, AWB tracking link to Shiprocket. |
| Order Success Page | ✅ Done | Shows order reference, saves to `localStorage`, links to tracking page. |
| Product Page FAQ & Reviews | ✅ Done | Pre-configured FAQ accordion and review cards to boost checkout trust and reduce support queries. |

---

## ✅ Phase 3.5: Compliance & Legal Pages — COMPLETE

Indian e-commerce regulatory compliance pages, all linked from the footer.

| Page | Route | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Terms of Service | `/terms` | ✅ Done | Covers pricing in INR, Razorpay processing, liability, governing law (India). |
| Privacy Policy | `/privacy` | ✅ Done | Explains data collection, third-party services (Supabase, Resend, Meta, Shiprocket). |

| Shipping Policy | `/shipping` | ✅ Done | 1-2 day processing, 3-7 day delivery pan-India, tracking via WhatsApp + email + website. |
| Contact Us | `/contact` | ✅ Done | Email, phone placeholder, office address placeholder, **Grievance Officer section** (required by Indian IT Act + Consumer Protection Rules 2020). |

> ⚠️ **Action needed**: Replace `[BUSINESS_NAME]`, `[REGISTERED_ADDRESS]`, `[GSTIN_PLACEHOLDER]`, `[GRIEVANCE_OFFICER_NAME]`, and `[PHONE_NUMBER]` placeholders with real details once KYC is complete.

---

## ✅ Phase 3.6: Premium Visual Redesign — COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED (2026-07-08)

Applied the 7-step plan in `Business hub/PostDuty_Premium_Design_Spec.md` on top of the premium `globals.css` tokens shipped 7 Jul. Presentation-only — no API/Supabase/Razorpay/admin logic touched.

| Step | File(s) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Fraunces display serif font | `src/app/layout.tsx` | ✅ Done |
| 2. Header — serif logo, taller bar | `src/components/Header.tsx` | ✅ Done |
| 3. Hero — wash bg, eyebrow, gold rule, trust strip | `src/app/page.tsx` | ✅ Done |
| 4. Product grid — premium cards, gold price tag | `src/app/page.tsx` | ✅ Done |
| 5. Product detail page | `src/app/products/[slug]/page.tsx` | ✅ Done |
| 6. Footer — serif brand, gold rule | `src/components/Footer.tsx` | ✅ Done |
| 7. Buttons everywhere (cart, checkout, order lookup) | `CheckoutForm.tsx`, `cart/page.tsx`, `order-success/page.tsx`, `orders/page.tsx`, `orders/[id]/page.tsx` | ✅ Done |

Each step committed separately; `npm run build` passes after every commit. **Live** at https://postduty.jijo925.workers.dev.

### ⚠️ Deploy incident + permanent fix (2026-07-08)
First deploy attempt of this design returned **500 on every route** in production (`ChunkLoadError: Failed to load chunk server/chunks/ssr/[root-of-the-server]__*._.js`). Root cause: Next.js 16's default **Turbopack** production build is incompatible with OpenNext-Cloudflare's Workers runtime chunk loading — not an app-code bug. Rolled back to the last good version (`21cf5d4f`) within minutes to restore service, diagnosed locally via `npm run preview` (safe, no prod impact) instead of redeploying blind, and confirmed the fix: **`package.json`'s `build` script now runs `next build --webpack`** instead of plain `next build`. Verified `/`, `/cart`, `/products/[slug]`, `/privacy`, `/orders` all return 200 locally before redeploying — second deploy succeeded cleanly. **Do not remove `--webpack` from the build script** — Turbopack production builds will silently break this deployment target again.

## 🚧 Phase 4: Launch Blockers — IN PROGRESS

These are the critical-path tasks required before the store can accept real money from real customers.

| # | Task | Status | Owner | What to do |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 4.1 | **Buy `postduty.in` domain** | 🔴 Not started | **J** | Buy on Cloudflare Dashboard → Domain Registration (~₹900/yr). Then add as custom domain in Workers settings. |

| 4.11 | **End-to-end test order** | 🔴 Blocked on 4.8 | **J** / **P** | Place one real order on live Razorpay. Verify: payment, DB entry, WhatsApp to customer, email to customer, admin alert, tracking update, order lookup page. |

## 💡 Playbook Improvements (Integrated ✅)

We reviewed the **Product-to-Customer Playbook** and integrated these 5 refinements directly into the document:

1. **Gift Option at Checkout** — Checkbox: "Is this a gift? Add a printed card (+₹20)". Lifts AOV and captures gifting events (NEET-PG results, convocations). *(Playbook §2.1)*
2. **Dynamic Preorder Shipping SLA** — Automated confirmations highlight "7-10 day delivery" for preorder items. Prevents chargebacks. *(Playbook §1.5)*
3. **Ambassador QR Stickers** — Custom sticker sheets with QR codes linking to personalized referral landing pages (e.g., `/ref/dr-anil`). For hostel notice boards. *(Playbook §2.6)*
4. **Lightweight Envelope Shipping** — Items under 100g ship in bubble mailer envelopes at ~₹20-25 instead of 500g boxes at ₹36-50. Doubles margin on single items. *(Playbook §4.1)*
5. **Native Cron Follow-ups** — Post-purchase messages (check-in, review ask, win-back) built as Cloudflare scheduled cron jobs at ₹0, replacing Make.com. *(Playbook §5.1)*
